* Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and login with your testing account that has Application developer or administrator permissions.
* Select **Azure Active Directory**, and select **App Registrations** from the left side bar. Then select **+ New registration**.
* Give any name to your app. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**.
* Set the **Redirect URI** drop down to **Web** and enter `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`. Then, select **Register**.
* Select **Certificates & secrets** tab in your registered app, and then **Client secrets**. Create a **New client secret** that never expires.

Make note of the **secret's value** as you'll use it in the next step. Also, navigate to **Overview tab** and make a note of the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll use them in the next steps.
